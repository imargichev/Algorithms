Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher
Maven
Getting Started
Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/imargichev/sorting-and-searching-algorithms.git
cd sorting-and-searching-algorithms
Build the project using Maven:  
mvn clean install
Run the main classes to see the algorithms in action.  
Algorithms
Linear Search
Performs a linear search on an array of integers.  
Binary Search
Performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers.  
Interpolation Search
Performs an interpolation search on a sorted array of integers.  
Merge Sort
Sorts an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.  
Quick Sort
Sorts an array of integers using the quick sort algorithm.  
Selection Sort
Sorts an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm.  
Usage
Each algorithm has a main method that demonstrates its usage. You can run these main methods to see the algorithms in action.
